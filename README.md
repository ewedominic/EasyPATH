# EasyPATH

Adds a context menu option to the Windows Explorer to add the selected item to the system environment variables list (AKA PATH).

## Installation

To install EasyPATH, just download and install the Installer.msi file.

## Usage

After installing EasyPATH, just right click on any file you wish to add to the PATH and click "Add to PATH". This will append the path of your target to the PATH environment variable.

Note: EasyPATH (1.0) does not check for duplicate path strings in the environment variable before appending a new path.

## Uninstallation
